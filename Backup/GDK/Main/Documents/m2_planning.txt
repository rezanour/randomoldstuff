M2 planning:

M2-exit scenario:
1. Launch game from Content Studio
  a. Splash Screen
  b. Main menu { Play game, Options, Exit }
  c. In-game
    i.   scripting environment, messaging, notifications - input, AI, and game logic
    ii.  implement basic AI for at least 2 enemies, have at least 1 pick up, level enter and exit markers, 2 levels, multiple lives, combat
    iii. basic collision, physics, and raycasts
    iv.  basic audio
    v.   bidirectional debug channel
    vi.  basic 2D layout & font system for menus & HUD

2. Tool-side scenarios:
  a. Real project creation
    i.   create/delete game objects, components, and assets
    ii.  edit game objects
    iii. new project types { blank, starting proj w/ cube, camera, and light }
  b. 3D scene view
    i.   grids, picking, selection
    ii.  widget, translate, rotate, scale
    iii. multi-select
    iv.  different render modes for view
    v.   billboards for 2D representation in 3d editor view
  c. debug console w/ multiple tabs - need to iron out debug channel APIs to help with this.
  d. 2D layout editor for menus and huds


High level features and implementation order:

1. Tools:
  1. project creation improvements
  2. 3d scene view & selection
  3. widget and transformations
  4. billboards and rendering modes
  5. debug console 
  6. 2D layout and fonts for UI and menus and HUD

2. Runtime
  1. basic geometry and collision
  2. scripting and messaging
  3. debug protocol and channel
  4. graphics improvements
  5. physics improvements


Debug channel:
1. Screen shot / live feed
