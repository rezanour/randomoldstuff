Fork of an old repo we had on TFS
=================================

Approx Date: 2010-2011

Contains various thing, mostly a version of my Lucid3D (L3D) renderer/engine and GDK. I'm not sure where this stacks up in the historical timeline of iterations of GDK.
Also contains a primitive remake of DOOM2 we started but never finished (all remakes were done with us trying to reinvent the algorithms in our interpretation, instead of copying the open-sourced Id Software code).
